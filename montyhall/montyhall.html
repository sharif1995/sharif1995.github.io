    <h1>Monty Hall Problem</h1>

    Welcome to the Monty Hall Problem. In this game, the player (you!) must select one of <b>three</b> doors.<br> Here's the problem, one of the doors contains a car... the other two doors contain a goat behind them. When you pick a door, the host will reveal one of the goats! Then will ask you if you want to switch or stay. Design the Monty Hall game using the starting code and functions, and then test to see if it really is better to switch or not.
