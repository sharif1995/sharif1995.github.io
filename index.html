<h1>Sharif's Code Portfolio</h1>
My name is Sharif Cooke-Riley.<br> 
I was in desperate need in a life change. <br>
My family havn't done anything major so I made it my goal to be the first to accomplish something. <br>
I had no prior skills to get into any job I actually wanted so I had to obtain a trade or a career.<br>
I was searching for something I would enjoy, that also had a friendly working environment.<br>
Then I discovered a program which is called Creative Tech Works, Which is in the S.T.E.M field. <br>
I joined the class and noticed that I would be making programs for others and I actually liked it. <br>
I've spent 4 months studying Javascript, HTML and CSS. Below are some of my work I've worked on...<br>
