<h1>Sharif's Code Portfolio</h1>
My name is sharif Cook-Riley.<br> 
I was in desperate need in a life change. <br>
My family havn't done anything major so i made it my goal to be the first to accomplish something. <br>
I had no prior skills to get into any job i actually wanted so i had to obtain a trade or a career.<br>
I was searching for something i would enjoy, that also had a friendly working environment.<br>
Then I discovered a program which is called Creative Tech Works, Which is in the S.T.E.M field. <br>
I joined the class and noticed that i would be making programs for others and i actually liked it. <br>
I've spent 4 months studying javascript, html and css. Below are some of my work i've worked on...<br>
